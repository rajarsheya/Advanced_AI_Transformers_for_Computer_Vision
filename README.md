# Advanced_AI_Transformers_for_Computer_Vision

This project explores the application of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification tasks using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. It focuses on leveraging pre-trained transformer models to classify flower images, demonstrating both zero-shot inference and fine-tuning techniques.

## Key Highlights

- Utilizes the `google/vit-base-patch16-224` transformer model.
- Loads and preprocesses a flower image dataset for classification.
- Performs image classification using pre-trained weights (zero-shot).
- Demonstrates model fine-tuning for improved task performance.
- Visualizes predictions along with confidence scores.
- Provides a streamlined pipeline for adapting ViT models to custom datasets.

This notebook serves as a hands-on example for applying cutting-edge transformer architectures to computer vision problems with minimal effort.
